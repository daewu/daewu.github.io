<b>The title</b> is extremely ironic, because Firmly Rooted is the title of San Lo's monthly catalog or update on church happenings. It is intended that what you're Firmly Rooted in is good, but mine started out as good, was actually bad. 2015 is a heck of a year, I didn't realize I was going through at least slight depression or anxiety, pain, weakness, sorrow. I was mentally not there many days, the year I turned 30, which there is so much pressure to be all there: making in the world, married, good son, brother, friend...just having it all together. 
<p>
So of course I try to give the image of being such a good Christian, good job, good family, good friends. I just wanted to be accepted, and there is a fear of being rejected because of messing up or not being the person I should be. I just wanted to accepted as I am. 

The sin is firmly rooted, or maybe even deeply rooted. It's so deep and I did such a good job of covering it up or sweeping it under the rug that I forget about it, but it always resurfaces one way or the other. My defense mechanism is so strong that I can just make my mind not care about something and it goes away.

I imagine cutting weeds of my sin and my shame off, it looks much better, looks like its gone, but it's still there. Sin can be so deeply rooted that it can effect the soil. I think the soil is tainted, I needed to completely start over. I need to redo the soil and start planting these holy seeds because that is the only way I can gave success under Jesus. I believe sin is so strong that even if you uproot the weed, if the soil is bad, planting holy seeds might not even work. The soil has to be good, the sun has to be there, there has to be rain. It takes a lot to grow a plant. 

I knew all of these analogies before but I never knew it could get out of hand. How it can affect every part of my life, until it did. I was in a very low and depressed state of mind, but I didn't know I was. The anger and the pain took over and I didn't know what to do. I closed off people in my life. There was so much negative thoughts in my  mind.
